# Vehicles-detection-and-counting
Final project of the course Vision and Cognitive Systems in the Physics of Data master degree at University of Padova.

## Description
Object detection is a highly demanding task in computer vision due to its relevance in today's world where high amounts of information are generated daily. As a consequence, many algorithms have been develop to filter visual media. YOLO (You only look once) is a powerful architecture capable of detecting, classifying and segmenting instances in photos and videos. This work is focused on testing the detection capacity of the last YOLO version using the smallest architecture and applying it on vehicle detection and counting.

## Language
Python
